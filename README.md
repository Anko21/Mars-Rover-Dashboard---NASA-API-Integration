# Mars Rover Dashboard - NASA API Integration
In this project, I designed and developed a Mars Rover Dashboard using Node.js, Express, and the NASA API. The interactive dashboard allows users to select their preferred Mars rover and view the latest images, mission details, launch date, landing date, and status. The project showcases my proficiency in using pure functions, higher-order functions, and array methods to efficiently retrieve and display data. Additionally, I incorporated mobile-first styling, making the UI responsive for various devices.
